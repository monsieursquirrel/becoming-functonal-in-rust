# becoming-functonal-in-rust

An attempt at converting the code examples from Joshua Backfield's book,
[Becoming Functional](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030331.do), into
Rust. Now you can follow along with refactoring code into a more functional
style in your new favorite language! Rust draws on some of the ideas from
functional programming so it'll be interesting to see if everything can be
implemented easily.


I've set up Cargo.toml to build the examples that will build; just checkout and run `cargo build`. Obviously, the
isolated code snippets are not buildable.
