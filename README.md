# becoming-functonal-in-rust

An attempt at converting the code examples from Joshua Backfield's book,
[Becoming Functional](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030331.do), into
Rust. Since Rust draws on some of the ideas of functional programming, I thought
it would be interesting to see how much could be implemented.

I've set up Cargo.toml to build the examples that will build. Obviously, the
isolated code snippets are not buildable.
